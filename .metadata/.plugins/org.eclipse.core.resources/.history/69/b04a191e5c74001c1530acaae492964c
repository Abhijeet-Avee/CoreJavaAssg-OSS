/*1. Student(String, String, double) – this will take the name, id and grade as parameter and initialize.
2. Student(String, String) – this will take the name and id as parameter and initialize.
3. Student(String) – this will take the id as parameter and initialize.
Note: For constructor, invoke the first constructor in the other 2. Similarly invoke/call display() in
display(int) method.*/
//Methods:
//1. display() – will display the name, id, grade if they have a value.
//2. display(int) – will take the current year of the student as parameter and display the name, id, grade
//and in which year the if they have a value.
//Now implement the application class that will have the main method. From main method, you have
//to provide a menu on the console. It will take user input to create the object using one of the 3 constructors.
//Which constructor you have to use depends on what info user has provided e.g. if user just provide id,
//you have to call Student(String) and so on. Do similar logic for option 2/display.
//‘1’ – to create a Student object.
//‘2’ – to display the student info.
